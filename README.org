* MÃ©lange (fictional drug):
"In the series, the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe is melange, a drug that gives the user a longer life span, greater vitality, and heightened awareness; it can also unlock prescience in some humans, depending upon the dosage and the consumer's physiology. This prescience-enhancing property makes safe and accurate interstellar travel possible. Melange comes with a steep price, however: it is addictive, and withdrawal is fatal. Harvesting melange is also hazardous in the extreme, as its only known source is the harsh desert planet Arrakis, and melange deposits are guarded by giant sandworms."

* How does this relate to computing?
** Goals
*** I don't like to repeat myself, ever. This repository will allow me to have a
matching machine across any device in my possession, minus the hardware differences
required for configuration. Cross phone/laptop/desktop/SBC/server, then define
only the difference you'd like in those machines (e.g. x86 binaries on desktop)
*** Any nix derivations for packages I create will originate from ./pkgs/
*** If shit hits the fan on any of my devices (hardware failure, broken phone
etc), I SHOULD be able to substitute any defined devices in its place.
*** Once you create a package, it should last forever. And it will here. Full
archival support for eternity thanks to nix and upcoming flakes standard.
**** I will NEVER have to fuck with legacy app/game support, thanks to nix and
wine/dosbox. See https://github.com/lutris/lutris/issues/666
*** With all of these goal above, we should be able to reimagine John McCarthy's
image of a universal network of computing power accessed by any "terminal"
